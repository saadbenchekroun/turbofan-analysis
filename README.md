Here's a detailed 20-day plan to accomplish your project:

### Day 1-2: Project Setup and Initial Planning
1. **Project Setup**:
   - Set up version control using Git.
   - Create a project repository on GitHub or another platform.
   - Set up the development environment (Node.js, React, PHP server, etc.).
2. **Initial Planning**:
   - Outline the project structure and components.
   - Break down each major feature into smaller tasks.

### Day 3-4: Design and Prototyping
1. **Design**:
   - Create wireframes and mockups for the main pages (use tools like Figma or Sketch).
   - Design the layout for the dashboard, analysis pages, and report pages.
2. **Prototyping**:
   - Build a basic HTML prototype to visualize the layout.
   - Use CSS for basic styling and MUI for components.

### Day 5-7: Backend Development
1. **Database Setup**:
   - Design the database schema for storing sensor data and analysis results.
   - Set up the database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
2. **Backend APIs**:
   - Develop APIs for data ingestion, processing, and retrieval using PHP.
   - Implement endpoints for uploading CSV files, fetching analysis results, etc.

### Day 8-10: Frontend Development - Part 1
1. **Setup React and MUI**:
   - Initialize the React project.
   - Set up routing and basic navigation.
2. **Develop Core Components**:
   - Create reusable components for the dashboard, graphs, and reports.
   - Integrate MUI components for a consistent UI.

### Day 11-13: Frontend Development - Part 2
1. **Data Visualization**:
   - Integrate charting libraries (like Chart.js or D3.js) for data visualization.
   - Develop components for displaying fuel efficiency graphs, performance curves, etc.
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Implement real-time data fetching and updating using WebSockets or polling.
   - Create a real-time health dashboard.

### Day 14-15: Analysis and Algorithms
1. **Fuel Efficiency and Thrust Performance Analysis**:
   - Implement algorithms for fuel efficiency analysis and thrust calculation.
   - Develop backend logic for comparing with expected metrics.
2. **Predictive Maintenance**:
   - Implement FFT for vibration analysis and ML models for RUL prediction.
   - Develop backend logic for lubrication system monitoring and alerts.

### Day 16-17: Health Monitoring and Efficiency Optimization
1. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Implement continuous health monitoring logic.
   - Develop backend logic for anomaly detection and out-of-threshold alerts.
2. **Efficiency Optimization**:
   - Implement analysis for fuel consumption optimization and operating conditions.
   - Develop backend logic for flight operations adjustments.

### Day 18: Safety Insights
1. **Critical Condition Detection**:
   - Implement logic for detecting critical conditions preceding failures.
   - Develop backend logic for actionable safety insights and incident analysis.

### Day 19: Testing and Debugging
1. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for both frontend and backend components.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together seamlessly.
2. **Debugging**:
   - Fix any bugs or issues identified during testing.
   - Ensure the application is stable and performs well.

### Day 20: Final Review and Deployment
1. **Final Review**:
   - Review the entire application for completeness and correctness.
   - Ensure all features are implemented and working as expected.
2. **Deployment**:
   - Set up the production environment.
   - Deploy the application to a web server or cloud platform.
   - Perform final testing in the production environment.
